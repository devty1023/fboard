fboard
======

Fboard is a project to port posts in a facebook group to a reddit-like board. 

In facebook groups, all posts are born equal - the posts with latests timestamp will seize the top spot of the group wall no matter how liked or commented it is.

This works for most facebook groups, but for large facebook groups, it's hard to deliver good user experiences as there is no effective way of sorting or promoting quality posts (I don't consider hashtag a good mechanism for this). 

Fboard is my attempt to change that - by implementing reddit-like scoring algorithm that is used to sift good posts from the bad.

A live demo for fboard can be found [here](http://sangcode-devty.rhcloud.com/). This port is for the group [생활코딩](https://www.facebook.com/groups/codingeverybody/), a Korean-developers group of more than 30,000+ members.

If you are insterested in using fboard to port your facebook group, feel free to discuss it with me.
